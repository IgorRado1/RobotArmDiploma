# ðŸ¥– RobotArmDiploma

This repository contains the code and project files for a proof-of-concept robotic sorting system developed as part of a **bachelor's thesis**. The goal is to automatically **sort bread objects** (white and black bread) based on **color and weight**, and to detect **box fullness** using sensors.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

## ðŸ§  Features

- **Color detection** (TCS3472)
- **Weight classification** (HX711 + 4-wire load cell)
- **Bread type recognition** based on color and weight
- **Bin fullness detection** using 2x HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors
- **LED Indicators** for full bins (4 red LEDs)
- **Real-time communication** between Arduino and TwinCAT via Python & pyads
- **PLC logic** handles movement and resets

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Used

- Arduino Uno
- TCS3472 color sensor
- HX711 + load cell
- 2Ã— HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors
- Fischertechnik R4 robotic hand
- Beckhoff CX7000 (TwinCAT)
- Breadboards, LEDs, resistors, wiring


## ðŸ–¥ TwinCAT PLC

Folder `RobotskaRokaV2/` contains:

- `GVL` with shared variables like `breadID` and `BinFullNumber`
- POUs for automatic robotic arm movement
- Main sorting logic implemented in the POU **`SortTest`** (FB) for the automatic sorting cycle  
- Function blocks (e.g., edge detection, timing)
- PLC mappings for inputs/outputs
- Logic to reset state and react to bin full

## ðŸš€ System Workflow

1. Arduino reads bread color, weight, and bin fullness.
2. A Python script (`pyads`) receives and sends processed data to the TwinCAT PLC.
3. The PLC executes robotic arm movement based on received bread ID.
4. If any bin is full, a corresponding LED lights up.
